    <P style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;color:white;">Founded by Ayush Sharma  on 20 sep 2022, Show on Hepflix
        launched with a very simple mission – to become one
        of the best review websites on the internet.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before Show on Hepflix To officially launched, a lot of the very early reviews can also be found on Amazon too, where
        Greg Wheeler was officially part of the Amazon Vine program – a prestigious title reserved for elite reviewers.
        <br>
        <br>
        What began with film reviews, quickly expanded to include full season TV show reviews. Album, soundtrack and
        videogame reviews followed closely behind, along with a litany of articles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Attracting visitors the world over, Show on Hepflix has grown from strength to strength over the years, adding
        film timelines, our “Best Of” articles and ‘Show on Hepflix on HepflixiewGeek Recommends” series – all of which suggestions from our
        readers!
